# js

## The data types you can store inside of array 

It can store numbers, strings, boolean values, characters, and objets, and so on. Or anything you need. 

## Is the people array a vaild JS array

Yes it is array in JS. To access the values stord you can us an index of the element you wat to access followed by by the index you want to retrieve within the element.

## Five shorthand operators 
* Assignment: Assing a value to a variable
* Addition assignment: It will perform addition which is either numeric addition or string concatenation
* subtraction assignment: Performs subtraction on the two operands and assigns the result to the left operand 
* Multiplication assignment: Performs multiplication on the two operands and assigns the result to the left operand
* Division assignment:performs division on the two operands and assigns the result to the left operand.

## Read the code 

It will add A to C and the result would be false

## Real world exeample of a conditional 
A real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program is in a user authentication system for a website. When a user attempts to log in, the JavaScript program can check if the user's username and password are correct by using a conditional statement. If the username and password match those in the database, the user is granted access to the website. However, if the username or password is incorrect, the JavaScript program can display an error message and prevent the user from accessing the website.

## Example of a loop in JS

Exampel: You have an array of 100 numbers and you want to calculate the sum of those numbers. Instead of writing 100 lines of code to manually add each number, you can use a loop to iterate over the array and add each number to a running total.
