## How to make a basic link with text

You would use < a> element. then put in the conten you want or need next to the link. it should look like < a href="url">link text</ a>.

## what the href contains 

It contains The URL (the actual link) and. The clickable text or object that users will see on the page (known as the “anchor text”)

## ways to make sure the link is accessible

* Use concise and meaningful text for links.
* Avoid using URLs for link text.
* Do not use the word "link" as part of the link text.
* Do not use tooltips/screentips to add additional information.

## What flow means 

the way that Block and Inline elements are displayed on a page before any changes are made to their layout.

## the differences between block-level 

Block elements always start from a new line. Inline elements never start from a new line. Block elements cover space from left to right as far as it can go. Inline elements only cover the space as bounded by the tags in the HTML element.

## positioning is the default for every html element

HTML elements are positioned static by default. Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.

## few advantages to using absolute positioning 

* Aside from a few IE bugs, very good cross-browser support
* Less dependence on floats, which can be problematic
* Less dependence on margins, which can be a bit buggy in older IE

##  key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning

Absolutely positioned elements are positioned with respect to a containing block, which is the nearest postioned ancestor. If there is no positioned ancestor, the viewport will be the containing block. Elements with fixed positioning are fixed with respect to the viewport—the viewport is always their containing block.

## The difference between function declaration and a function invocation.

The difference between function declaration and function expression
Function declarations are similar to var; they will be automatically hoisted, whereas function expressions will not be hoisted. In simple terms, function declarations will load before any other code, and function expressions will load when the interpreter reaches it.


## The difference between a parameter and an argument

Function parameters are the names listed in the function's definition. Function arguments are the real values passed to the function
