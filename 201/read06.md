## description of objects 

An object is like a container that holds different pieces of information about a thing. Imagine a toy box filled with different types of toys. Each toy has its own unique features like color, size, and shape. In programming, we use objects to hold and manipulate data. You can change the values of the information in the object or add and remove pieces of information as needed. So, an object is like a toy box where each toy is a piece of data and the object holds all of the information about that data.

## advantages of creating object literals

The advantages of using object literals to create objects include convenience, flexibility in declaration, and less code during declaration.

## How do objects differ from arrays?

Objects represent a special data type that is mutable and can be used to store a collection of data (rather than just a single value). Arrays are a special type of variable that is also mutable and can also be used to store a list of values.

## example of bracket notation

person.age;
person.name.first;


## The term this refers to

This is the name of the dog and the age *7 of the dog.

## what DOM is 

It is Document Object Model 

##

The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface that represents a web page as a tree-like structure. JavaScript can interact with the DOM to dynamically modify the content and behavior of a web page. By using JavaScript to manipulate the elements of the DOM, developers can create dynamic and interactive web applications.
