## Explain why we need domain modeling.

Domain modeling is an essential tool for software engineering: if you only model one thing in Agile, model the domain. Even a relatively small domain modeling effort is an excellent tool for reducing the complexity of system development. It helps clarify requirements and the design intent.

## Why should tables not be used for page layouts?

HTML tables were originally intended to be used for presenting tabular data, not for layout. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3CÂ®) discourages use of tables for layout because they are striving for a web in which content and structure are completely separate from presentation.

## constructor and the advsntages of them 

A constructor is useful when you want to create multiple similar objects with the same properties and methods. It's a convention to capitalize the name of constructors to distinguish them from regular functions.

## How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?


In JavaScript, the keyword "this" is used to refer to the current execution context. When used in an object literal, "this" refers to the object being defined. It allows you to reference other properties within the same object during its creation.On the other hand, when "this" is used in a constructor function, it refers to the newly created object instance that the constructor is being called on. It allows you to set properties on the object being created.
