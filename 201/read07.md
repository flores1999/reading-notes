Domain modeling is an essential tool for software engineering: if you only model one thing in Agile, model the domain. Even a relatively small domain modeling effort is an excellent tool for reducing the complexity of system development. It helps clarify requirements and the design intent.

## Why should tables not be used for page layouts?

HTML tables were originally intended to be used for presenting tabular data, not for layout. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3CÂ®) discourages use of tables for layout because they are striving for a web in which content and structure are completely separate from presentation.
