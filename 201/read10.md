## Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error

A syntax error is an error in the syntax of a sequence of characters or tokens that is intended to be written in a particular programming language. A logical error is an error in a program that causes it to operate incorrectly but not to terminate abnormally. A syntax error occurs due to fault in the program syntax

## List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

* Missing or misplaced parentheses: this is an easy fix but I just found where I was missing one and added one.
* Missing or misplaced semicolons: At times it is a simple thing to look over but I just got in the habit of adding one.

## How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

I will just make sure to check and make sure everything is where it needs to be and spelling is correct.

## How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

The JavaScript Debugger tool is a valuable resource for software developers, especially those starting out. It helps you analyze and debug your code by allowing you to pause the execution of your JavaScript program at specific points and inspect its behavior. With the debugger, you can step through your code line by line, examine variable values, and identify and fix issues. It works by setting breakpoints at specific lines or functions in your code, and when the program reaches those breakpoints, it stops executing, giving you the opportunity to examine the program's state and behavior. You can then use the debugger to navigate through your code, observe variable values, and analyze the flow of execution, enabling you to pinpoint and resolve bugs or unexpected behaviors. The JavaScript Debugger is a powerful tool that provides insight into your code's execution and is an essential companion for software developers seeking to understand and troubleshoot their JavaScript programs.

## Define what a breakpoint is.

A breakpoint is a designated point in your code where you want the program's execution to pause temporarily during debugging. It is a marker or flag that you set at a specific line or function to indicate to the debugger that you want to stop the program's execution at that particular point. When the program reaches a breakpoint, it halts its execution, allowing you to examine the program's state, variables, and other relevant information. This pause gives you the opportunity to analyze the code's behavior, step through the program line by line, and identify and diagnose any issues or unexpected behaviors. Breakpoints are an essential tool in the debugging process, providing developers with granular control over code execution and helping them pinpoint and resolve errors effectively.

## What is the call stack?

The call stack is a tracking mechanism that maintains the order and hierarchy of function calls in a program. It acts like a stack, adding function frames when functions are called and removing them when they complete. This allows the program to know where to return after each function finishes its execution. The call stack plays a vital role in managing the flow of execution and preserving the context of function calls throughout the program.
