## What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?

The transform CSS property lets you rotate, scale, skew, or translate an element. It modifies the coordinate space of the CSS visual formatting model.

## Example of a transform

transform: rotate(45deg);

In this case, the transform: rotate(45deg) rule is applied to a box element. It rotates the box by 45 degrees clockwise. When this CSS is applied to an HTML element, the box will be displayed with a 45-degree rotation.
